### Project background

SATRE (Standardised Architecture for Trusted Research Environments) is a collaborative research project between the University of Dundee, Ulster University, UCL, HDR UK, The Alan Turing Institute & Research Data Scotland, and funded by DARE UK. 
We’re building a reference TRE architecture and accompanying implementation, using a community driven approach. More details on the project can be found on our [initial blog post](https://medium.com/satre/satre-receives-dare-uk-driver-project-funding-3bac73db1144).

Our work is split into 5 work packages:
1. **Evaluation and reference specification**: The open development of a reference TRE specification, co-created with the community. You can see the latest on this work in the dedicated [specification repo](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification)
2. **Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE)**: Delivering a comprehensive, meaningful PPIE plan across the whole of the project
3. **Formalisation of the pluggable reference architecture**: Defining how the reference architecture will work with organisational information governance policies & processes
4. **Implementation and assessment of a reference TRE architecture**: Implementing the specification from WP1 in production.
5. **Community building & engagement**: Ensuring all work delivered across work packages is done in collaboration with the wider community.

### Purpose of this repo
As a project, we have committed to working as openly as we can.
This repo will primarily be about project management - sharing in the open the work we are doing across our work packages to deliver our project.
In the future, this may also contain resources/tools that we develop and use across the project, to be accessible for the community/
